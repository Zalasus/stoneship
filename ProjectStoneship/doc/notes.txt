ATM Entities and Bases have nealy the same structure. So what seperates them? Well,
currently Entities are created for every reference in a cell. They reflect all properties
given by their Base. They only difference is they may be modified at runtime. Why not let
Bases represent placed objects, too, and make the kind of Bases that are referenced const
or something. Problem: we need to create copies for every placed instance. theres no clear
seperation between what is placed in the world and what defines those things.
maybe we should keep the current model, even if it is not minimal. 

entities create modify records, supply methods for saving... wait, the editor also needs these methods
in base classes...
