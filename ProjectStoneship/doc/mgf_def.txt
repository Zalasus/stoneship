
Master Game File specification 1.0
==================================


Data types
----------
All basic types defined as in KISDF 1.1.
Additional type structures in KIDDML format:

dependency = {sstring: filename, short: ordinal}
recordHint = {short: type, int: offset, int: count}
resource = {byte: type, byte: priority, sstring: path}
subrecord = {short: type, int: size, byte[~]: data} (6 bytes overhead)
uid = {short: ordinal, int: id}
record = {short: type, int: sizeInBytes, short: flags, int: recordId, byte[~]: data}
record_group = {short: type = 0x0000, int: sizeInBytes, short: groupType, int: childRecordCount, record[~]: records}


File structure
--------------
The following lines are a KIDDML representation of the MGF format.

(file header)

byte[8]: 		 magic id = "NRPG3MGF"
bstring:		 game id
short:			 file flags

(meta information)
sstring:		 author (name of MGF's author)
sstring:		 description (descripton of MGF's content)
ulong:           timestamp (in UNIX epoch milliseconds format)

short:			 dependency count
dependency[~]:	 dependencies (list of MGFs which hold content that's used by this MGF and must be loaded before it)

short:			 resource count
resource[~]:	 resources (a list of paths/archive files where this MGFs BLOBs are stored)


(records)

int:             record count (total count of records in the MGF)
int:			 record top group count
record_group[~]: record groups

byte:            end marker = 0xF0


File flags
----------
The file header has a 16-bit-field for 16 boolean flags. At the moment, none of the flags
are used, because why would you use flags for anything?


Resource files
--------------
All resources used by the engine are adressed via a virtual file system which maps internal resource paths
to the underlying system's file system. This virtual file system uses a system-independent, fixed naming scheme
for it's paths, which is defined as follows:

Folders are seperated by slash characters '/' (UNIX-Style paths)

The file system originates from a root directory, designated by '/'. This, however, is
an optional prefix, since the file system has no need for relative paths.
Therefore '/mdl/sas' and 'mdl/sas' _always_ point to the same directory.

Double slashes ('/snd/sas//foo.ogg') are ignored.

On root level, every type of resource is stored in it's own subfolder. The following types are defined:
	/mdl/    Model files
	/mat/    Material files
	/tex/    Texture files
	/snd/    Sound files
	/shd/    Shader programs
	/loc/    Locale files
	
These associations are implicit and enforced, meaning when a model is requested, the '/mdl/...' part
of it's path is added by the engine. Requesting '/mdl/cube.model' will result in '/mdl/mdl/cube.model' beeing
looked up.

By default, the engine maps the resource root to a folder named 'res/' in it's running directory. However, a MGF
may specify additional resource locations, which are defined in it's resource location header field and are used
aside the default location of the engine. Resource locations may be folders or archive files. The type field in a
resource entry specifies how to handle the resource given in the path field. The following values are possible:

	0: Single file
	1: File system (for simple folders)
	2: Zip file (resources are packed in a .zip archive)
	3: Gzip file (Implementation is considered optional for now)
	
Real file system paths given in the resource path field should be relative. The engine accepts both '/' and '\' as directory
seperators, and internally replaces them to match the system's ones (so MGFs created under UNIX can be used in DOS environments
like Microsoft Windows). However, it can not remap absoulte paths, so a MGF defining 'C:/example/' as a resource path would be
unusable under UNIX.
	
Resource locations are searched by priority until the wanted resource is found, with the default priority beeing:
	1. 'res/'-Folder
	2. Requesting MGF's locations
	3. Other MGF's locations
	
This behaviour can, however, be altered by the priority field in a resource entry (independent of other entries in the same file).
The following priority settings are defined:
	0: Default priority (2nd when requested by same MGF, 3rd otherwise)
	1: Before default (Always 1st, before 'res/'-Folder and other MGFs)
	
During loading resource paths are gathered and organized to best meet the defined priorities. When a MGF defined multiple paths with the
same priority setting, they are organized in the order they were defined in the MGF's header. When multiple MGFs define one or more
resource path with the same priority, the paths of the last loaded MGF get searched before the paths of the ones loaded before the last MGF.

This priority system's purpose is to allow the easy creation of MGFs which override a game's default resources like a HD texture patch etc.
In that case the modder could store the new textures in an archive file, define that file as a resource location with priority setting 1 of an
otherwise empty MGF and instruct users to load the HD mod _after_ the main game files. 


Size fields
-----------
Many structures in Master Game Files contain size fields given in bytes. These almost exclusively precede array structures
and never contain the size of any other fields in the structure including the size field itself.


Record groups
-------------
The main unit of record storage in a MGF are record groups. These containers list records of the same type and
allow fast skipping through the file. Additionally, record groups may be embedded in subrecords(see chapter "Records") of 
other records which need a set of data that can't be stored efficiently in subrecords or has a typical record structure (with UID etc.).
For instance, a Dungeon record contains a subrecord of type 0, containing a group of Entity records, in turn containing all Entities in this Dungeon.

Child records (records contained within a data field which still have a full record header) are only valid for records of type Group.
Every other record type must either store all it's data in subrecords directly, or encapsulate a group record in the special Group-subrecord type.
This convention ensures consitency in the structure of the record's data fields and stuff.

Since record groups contain whole records as subunits, and records are not guaranteed to be read entirely by the
application, the amount of remaining bytes in the record data field is no safe indicator whether a full record is still
available or not. Therefore, group records provide an additional child record count field to the byte size field.

Upon loading, all top groups and their respective offsets in the file are indexed so record groups may
be found quickly when specific types of records are requested for load.


Dynlen
------
(still LE!!!)
00000000 - 01111111
10000000 00000000 - 11111111 01111111
...



IDs / UIDs
----------
Each record (see next chapter) holds an 4-byte wide identifier that is used to uniquely reference the object/entity/etc
defined by the record. The special ID 0xFFFFFFFF is used for records without the need for reference by other records.
It is the only ID that is allowed to exist more than once each MGF.

Wherever a record refers to another record, a 6-byte wide identifier is used. This so-called UID (unique identifier)
consists of the ordinal number of the MGF that defines the referenced record (a short field that prepends the int ID field)
and the 4-byte-ID of the referenced record. If, however, a record refers to another record defined in the same MGF, the special
MGF ordinal 0xFFFF is used. This special MGF ordinal is also used in savegames for objects/entities/etc
that are not defined in any MGF but were created during gameplay. Thus, the currently loaded savegame will always have the ordinal 0xFFFF.
Please note that the endianness of the ordinal/ID is treated as if both fields were seperate structures: {short, int}

This system restricts NRPG3 to a maximum possible MGF count of 65.535 with 4.294.967.296 IDs each. This amount
should be sufficient for any application the engine might have in it's lifespan.


Records
-------
The main data unit in a MGF is a record. A MGF may contain up to (2^32)-1 = 4294967295 records (Only in theory. In practice, amounts
this high will most likely fail on 32-bit platforms as NRPG relies heavily on offset indices).

Every record has a 16 bit wide type ID that gives information on the type of the record's content. A table of
type IDs is given below.

A record contains a size field that contains the total size of the record's data field. It is used for skipping single records 
without having to read all it's data.

Each record holds a 4-byte-wide identifier that is used to reference the object/entity/etc defined by the record.
Some records may not use this field, in which cases it is set to the reserved value of 0xFFFFFFFF.
For more information on these IDs, see the previous chapter "IDs / UIDs"
	

For additional data, every record contains a flag byte. The meanings of the flag bits are as follows:

	Bit 0 -> DELETED:           If set, this record is scratched, and should not be bought
	Bit 1 -> FULLOFEELS:        If set, your hovercraft is full of eels (The sane reader can consider this bit as unused)
	Bit 2 -> EDATA_PRESENT:     If set, this record contains an _EDITOR_DATA subrecord (does not apply for GROUP records)

The data of records is stored in subrecords which consist of an 16 bit type ID that is specific for the record's
type ID, meaning that subrecords with equal type IDs must not necessarily contain the same type of data unless
the type ID of their respective record is equal, too. Some groups of record types, however, store common
information in specific subrecords.

The subrecord itself is basically a byte array which is interpreted differently depending of the subrecord's type ID.
Because the [Modify] record (described in the following section) lists modifications on subrecord level, the smallest
possible modification if a field affects all other fields stored in the same subrecord. Therefore a subrecord should
only contain one field or a set of fields which can be assumed to be always modified together.

Some subrecords may be optional for some type of records. Those may appear once or never in the record. Most other 
defined subrecord types must appear exactly once. If such a subrecord is defined more than once, the result is
undefined. Some subrecord types, however, may appear more than once.

If a record contains subrecords that are not defined/not used by that type of record, they are simply ignored.


Modify records
--------------
As of the incremental nature of the MGF ressource management, it is neccessary that a MGF can modify any
record present in one of it's dependent files in a way that does not require UID indirection. This functionality is
provided through [Modify] records which may adress any record that is identified by a UID. The structure of those
records depends on their target record type, and in most cases simply consists of all subrecords that differ from
their original definition.

Every [Modify] record provides metadata in the reserved FFF9 subrecord. The metadata consists of the target UID,
the type of the target record (for hinting the modification table) and a field that was formerly used as a mod type
designator but is now considered unused. It is, however, still included because who needs hard drive space anyway?

Modify records are ID-less, so the ID field in their record header contains the default value of 0xFFFFFFFF.


World records
-------------
Entities in NRPG3 are contained within worlds, of which two types exist: Outdoor Worlds and Dungeon Worlds.
Each are represented by a distinct record in their MGF which contains basic metadata about the world. Due to the
vast amount of objects/visual information/references contained within a world, data like Entities, Heightmaps etc.
is stored in seperate records which are grouped together and are stored right after the record they belong to.

The structure of Dungeons and Outdoors differs greatly. An Outdoor consists of a set of Chunks, which in turn
define the Entities contained within among other data like heightmaps etc. While not especially reserved for
outdoor places, Outdoor worlds are the preferred way of creating worlds with big amounts of scenery which in which
freedom of movement and thus dynamic loading and unloading of distant objects is desired.

The structure of Dungeons is more basic. They consist of just one single unit in which all entities are contained.
Upon loading of a Dungeon, all Entities within are loaded and placed in the game. Distant objects are not unloaded.
Same as Outdoor worlds are not exclusively for outdoor spaces, Dungeons are not neccessarily reserved for places
meant to represent indoor worlds. Both have the ability to display a skybox or terrain, for instance. However, due 
to the organization of stored data, a Dungeon is preferably the way to construct smaller spaces, since it's simple
data structure avoids loading times and bloating of MGFs.

The record structure of Outdoor worlds is as follows:
Outdoors are defined in the Outdoor top group. An [Outdoor] record defines the world's metadata (dimensions, name etc.).
The [Outdoor] record is followed by a [Chunk Group] record (without UID) which in turn contains a set of nested
[Chunk Group]s. The nested layer represents rows (x-constant) of chunks. The rows are not neccesarily continuous, as
a world may arbitrarily define chunks anywhere in the grid, and thus rows may contain no chunk at all in which case the
row group is omitted. In order to identify the x coordinate to which a row group belongs, a subrecord is inserted in front
of the groups child records.
