
Master Game File specification 1.0
==================================


Data types
----------
All basic types defined as in KISDF 1.1.
Additional type structures in KIDDML format:

dependency = {sstring: filename, short: ordinal}
recordHint = {short: type, int: offset, int: count}
resource = {byte: type, sstring: path}
subrecord = {short: type, int: size, byte[~]: data} (6 bytes overhead)
uid = {short: ordinal, int: id}
record = {short: type, int: sizeInBytes, short: flags, int: recordId, byte[~]: data}
record_group = {short: type = 0x0000, int: sizeInBytes, short: groupType, int: childRecordCount, record[~]: records}


File structure
--------------
The following lines are a KIDDML representation of the MGF format.

(file header)

byte[8]: 		 magic id = "NRPG3MGF"
bstring:		 game id
int:			 file flags

(meta information)
sstring:		 author (name of MGF's author)
sstring:		 description (descripton of MGF's content)
ulong:           timestamp (in UNIX epoch milliseconds format)

short:			 dependency count
dependency[~]:	 dependencies (list of MGFs which hold content that's used by this MGF and must be loaded before it)

short:			 resource count
resource[~]:	 resources (a list of paths/archive files where this MGFs BLOBs are stored)


(records)

int:             record count (total count of records in the MGF)
int:			 record group count
record_group[~]: record groups

byte:            end marker = 0xF0


File flags
----------
The file header has a 32-bit-field for 32 boolean flags. The following bits
are defined:

bit 0: If set, this bit indicates the MGF is evil and should not be loaded
bit 1: If set, this bit incicates the MGF was created by a total idiot
bit 2: If set, this bit indicated the creator of the MGF is aware that there are way too many bits in the flag field


Resource files
--------------
A MGF may specify additional resource locations, which are used aside the default locations of the engine.
Resource locations may be folders or archive files. The type field in a resource entry speciefies how to
handle the resource given in the path field. The following values are possible:

	0: Single file
	1: File system (for simple folders)
	2: Zip file (resources are packed in a .zip archive)
	3: Gzip file (Implementation is considered optional for now)


Size fields
-----------
Many structures in Master Game Files contain size fields given in bytes. These almost exclusively precede array structures
and never contain the size of any other fields in the structure including the size field itself.


Record groups
-------------
The main unit of record storage in a MGF are record groups. These containers list records of the same type and
allow fast skipping through the file. Additionally, record groups may follow ordinary records that need a
set of data that can't be stored in subrecords. For instance, a Dungeon record is followed by a group of Entity records,
containing all Entities in this Dungeon.

Since record groups contain whole records as subunits, and records are not guaranteed to be read entirely by the
application, the amount of remaining bytes in the record data field is no safe indicator whether a full record is still
available or not. Therefore, group records provide an additional child record count field to the byte size field.

Upon loading, all top groups and their respective offsets in the file are indexed so record groups may
be found quickly when specific types of records are requested for load.


Dynlen
------
(still LE!!!)
00000000 - 01111111
10000000 00000000 - 11111111 01111111
...



IDs / UIDs
----------
Each record (see next chapter) holds an 4-byte wide identifier that is used to uniquely reference the object/entity/etc
defined by the record. The special ID 0xFFFFFFFF is used for records without the need for reference by other records.
It is the only ID that is allowed to exist more than once in MGFs.

Wherever a record refers to another record, a 6-byte wide identifier is used. This so-called UID (unique identifier)
consists of the ordinal number of the MGF that defines the referenced record (a short field that prepends the int ID field)
and the 4-byte-ID of the referenced record. If, however, a record refers to another record defined in the same MGF, the special
MGF ordinal 0xFFFF is used. This special MGF ordinal is also used during in savegames and while playing for objects/entities/etc
that are not defined in any MGF but were created during gameplay.
Please note that the endianness of the ordinal/ID is treated as if both fields were seperate structures: {short, int}

This system restricts NRPG3 to a maximum possible MGF count of 65.535 with 4.294.967.296 IDs each. This amount
should be sufficient for any application the engine might have in it's lifespan.


Records
-------
The main data unit in a MGF is a record. A MGF may contain up to (2^32)-1 = 4294967295 records (Only in theory.
Amounts this high will most likely fail as indices in MGFs are only 32 bits wide).

Every record has a 16 bit wide type ID that gives information on the type of the record's content. A table of
type IDs is given below.

A record contains a size field that contains the total size of the record's data field. It is used for skipping single records 
without having to read all it's data.

Each record holds a 4-byte-wide identifier that is used to reference the object/entity/etc defined by the record.
Some records may not use this field, in which cases it is set to the reserved value of 0xFFFFFFFF.
For more information on these IDs, see the previous chapter "IDs / UIDs"
	

For additional data, every record contains a flag byte. The meanings of the flag bits are as follows:

	Bit 0 -> DELETED:        If set, this record is scratched, and should not be bought
	Bit 1 -> FULLOFEELS:     If set, your hovercraft is full of eels (The sane reader can consider this bit as unused)

The data of records is stored in subrecords which consist of an 16 bit type ID that is specific for the record's
type ID, meaning that subrecords with equal type IDs must not necessarily contain the same type of data unless
the type ID of their respective record is equal, too. Some groups of record types, however, store common
information in specific subrecords.

The subrecord itself is basically a byte array which is interpreted differently depending of the subrecord's type ID.
Because the [Modify] record (described in the following section) lists modifications on subrecord level, the smallest
possible modification if a field affects all other fields stored in the same subrecord. Therefore a subrecord should
only contain one field or a set of fields which can be assumed to be always modified together.

Some subrecords may be optional for some type of records. Those may appear once or never in the record. Most other 
defined subrecord types must appear exactly once. If such a subrecord is defined more than once, the result is
undefined. Some subrecord types, however, may appear more than once.

If a record contains subrecords that are not defined/not used by that type of record, they are simply ignored.


Modify records
--------------
As of the incremental nature of the MGF ressource management, it is neccessary that a MGF can modify any
record present in one of it's dependent files in a way that does not require UID indirection. This functionality is
provided through [Modify] records which may adress any record that is identified by a UID. The structure of those
records depends on their target record type, and in most cases simply consists of all subrecords that differ from
their original definition.

Every [Modify] record provides metadata in the reserved FFF9 subrecord. The metadata consists of the target UID,
the type of the target record (for hinting the modification table) and a field that was formerly used as a mod type
designator but is now considered unused. It is, however, still included because who needs hard drive space anyway?

Modify records are ID-less, so the ID field in their record header contains the default value of 0xFFFFFFFF.


Record types

Subrecords marked with [Optional] may appear once or never.
Subrecords marked with [*] may appear arbitrarily often, including never.
